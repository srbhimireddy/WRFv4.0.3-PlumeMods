The ideal em_plume test case:

This test case produces a buoyant thermal plume in large-eddy simulation (LES) of a
neural boundary layer (NBL).  

The environmental wind (or the initial wind profile) is set to zero in this default case.

The ambience convection can be given by chaning the tke_heat_flux variable in namelist.
And the plume source is specified by tke_heat_flux_hot and heat_flux_len variables.  

A random perturbation is imposed initially on the mean temperature 
field at the lowest grid levels (chosen by user from namelist dynamics) to kick off the
turbulent motion. Double periodic boundary condition is used in x and y.

The default version is 2D and uses a grid resolution of dx=dy=40m and dz=10m.

All other options in the namelist are kept as ideal les case. 

For running a 3D plume, WRF diffusion files are to be modifed and WRF recompiled.
